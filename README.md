# ⚖️ Welcome to Code Judge! 🚀

Hey there, fellow coder! 👋 Welcome to **Code Judge**, your very own pocket-sized Online Judge! Think of it like a mini Codeforces, but super easy to play with and learn from. 🎈

Built with love using **Flask** 🌶 and **Next.js** ⚛️, this little judge lets you submit Python code, runs it against secret test cases, and gives you that sweet, sweet verdict! 🟢

## 🧠 The Magic Behind the Curtain

Ever wondered how a judge works? It's like a tiny robot 🤖 doing this:
1. **Grabs** your code from the API.
2. **Writes** it into a safe little temporary file.
3. **Runs** it in a special subprocess with your input.
4. **Catches** the output (and any errors!).
5. **Compares** it to the correct answer.
6. **Delivers** your shiny verdict! 🏆

## 🧭 The Road Ahead (Our Roadmap)

We're constantly growing! Here's what's cooking:
- 🟢 **Phase 0 & 1**: Core foundations & Verdicts (Done! 🎉)
- 🟡 **Phase 2**: Handling multiple test cases (Working on it! 🛠)
- 🔵 **Phase 3**: Better problem definitions (Planned! 📐)
- 🔐 **Phase 4**: Super secure sandboxing with Docker (Soon! 🐳)
- 🌐 **Phase 5**: Submissions history & User accounts (The dream! ✨)

## Running the Project (Local Backend Required) / Pardon for this inconvinience

This project uses a locally hosted backend for code execution.

To test the application:
1. Clone the backend repository / Or extract the `judge-backend.zip` file.
2. Run the Flask server locally fron judge-backend
3. Open the deployed frontend
4. The frontend will communicate with the local backend at `http://localhost:5000`

ALTERNATE: (FOR WINDOWS 10+)
1. Clone the backend repository / Or download the `judge-backend_s.zip` file and script.ps1 file only
2. Downloads folder (or wherever you downloaded it), Open in powershell, run Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass (allows script.ps1 to run for current session.
3. run .\script.ps1
