# ⚖️ Welcome to Code Judge! 🚀

Hey there, fellow coder! 👋 Welcome to **Code Judge**, your very own pocket-sized Online Judge! Think of it like a mini Codeforces, but super easy to play with and learn from. 🎈

Built with love using **Flask** 🌶 and **Next.js** ⚛️, this little judge lets you submit Python code, runs it against secret test cases, and gives you that sweet, sweet verdict! 🟢

## 🧠 The Magic Behind the Curtain

Ever wondered how a judge works? It's like a tiny robot 🤖 doing this:
1. **Grabs** your code from the API.
2. **Writes** it into a safe little temporary file.
3. **Runs** it in a special subprocess with your input.
4. **Catches** the output (and any errors!).
5. **Compares** it to the correct answer.
6. **Delivers** your shiny verdict! 🏆

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here’s how to get the party started on your local machine! 🎈

## ⚠️ WARNING NOTE ⚠️
* If you want to test the code submissions aggressively, multiple submissions and high number of IDE execution, then I'll suggest you to fire up the backend on your machine. Current deployment can't handle that large number of submissions.

### 🌶 1. Fire up the Backend (for aggressive testing)
```bash
cd judge-backend
python app.py
```
*Your judge is now waiting for submissions at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`!*

### ⚛️ 2. Boot up the Frontend
```bash
cd judge-frontend
npm install  # (First time only!)
npm run dev
```
*Open `http://localhost:3000` and start coding!* 🎊

## 🧭 The Road Ahead (Our Roadmap)

We're constantly growing! Here's what's cooking:
- 🟢 **Phase 0 & 1**: Core foundations & Verdicts (Done! 🎉)
- 🟡 **Phase 2**: Handling multiple test cases (Working on it! 🛠)
- 🔵 **Phase 3**: Better problem definitions (Planned! 📐)
- 🔐 **Phase 4**: Super secure sandboxing with Docker (Soon! 🐳)
- 🌐 **Phase 5**: Submissions history & User accounts (The dream! ✨)
